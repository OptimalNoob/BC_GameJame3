This is a doc to outline some of the things that still need to be done.

-Apply uv coord info on cube function, is tedious so I'm holding off on it for now

-Convert enemy into a series of 3D planes to allow for easy 3D collision checking.
	-Might use multiple buffers?

-In addition to the above, perhaps find a way to facilitate easier texture grouping.
	-Not completely necessary, however it would improve work speed in the future
 
-Explore the timeline feature to construct levels. This would allow frame by frame control of spawning.

-Create basic art to convey the "story".
	-Main character
	-The antagonists
	-Some form of supporting cast? For instance, end of level shopkeep?
