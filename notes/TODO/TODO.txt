This is a doc to outline some of the things that still need to be done and general thoughts.

//-Small thought dump on bullets. We don't exactly have the luxury of using the built-in collision detection
//gamemaker has. That's important becuase it allows us to get the actual instance id of the colliding object.
//We could attempt to use the standard 2d collision, which would return regardless of depth. But it also
//gives us an ID, so we could check the zmov coordinate that we know we should have and compare to see if it
//is a true hit. I really hope that works.

//-Convert enemy into a series of 3D planes to allow for easy 3D collision checking.
//	-Might use multiple buffers?

//-In addition to the above, perhaps find a way to facilitate easier texture grouping.
//	-Not completely necessary, however it would improve work speed in the future
 
//-Explore the timeline feature to construct levels. This would allow frame by frame control of spawning.

//-Apply uv coord info on cube function, is tedious so I'm holding off on it for now

-Create basic art to convey the "story".
	-Main character
	-The antagonists
	-Some form of supporting cast? For instance, end of level shopkeep?
